#ConfirMZ PseudoCode
# Goal: Check if product ions and precursor ions have peaks at the same or similar times.
# 		A greater shift in peak time indicates a greater chance of a false positive identification
#
#		Track- hereafter referring to the process of accumulating the intensity data of a specific m/z value for the duration of a gradient
#
# Route A: Take a list of known identifications and track their theoretical product ions in parallel
#				-For Glycopeps From IdentificationList
#					-Pull From GlycoPep A: Precursor m/z, Product Ion List*
#					-Track In Parallel:
#						-Product Ions from Product Ion List
#						-Precursor Ion
#						-Smooth curves (impute where there was no ion collection)
#					-Find peaks in the various m/z
#					-Check distance between peaks and compare against threshold**
#				-Spit out (**likelihood of) confirmation for each Glycopep
#				-For RemainingGlycopeps From Library
#					-Pull From GlycoPep A: Precursor m/z, Product Ion List*
#					-Track In Parallel:
#						-Product Ions from Product Ion List
#						-Precursor Ion
#						-Smooth curves (impute where there was no ion collection)
#					-Find peaks in the various m/z
#					-Check distance between peaks and compare against threshold**
#				-Spit out (**likelihood of) confirmation for each Glycopep

#		* 	= We will likely have to access GlycReSoft functions to get this list
#		** 	= We can do fun math stuff to get the likelihood of them being from the same distribution or just do a thresholding distance from the precursor peak

#
# Route B: Track all MS1 and MS2 Space
#			-Create MS1 Matrix (n[m/z bins] x m[time points] )
#			-Create MS2 Matrix (n[m/z bins] x  m[time points] )
#				-Iterate through all scans and track all m/z bins into matrices
#				-Smooth tracks
#			-Identify Peaks in precursors
#			-Identify clusters of peaks in product ions
#			-Check precursor peaks against library
#			-Confirm alignment with product ions
#			-Check for missed precursor identifications
